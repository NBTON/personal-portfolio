# Personal Portfolio

This is a personal portfolio website designed to showcase your projects, skills, and experience. The portfolio is built using HTML and includes images and other resources to present your work in a visually appealing way.

## Features
- Home page with an introduction
- Gallery of images and screenshots
- Sections for projects, skills, and contact information
- Responsive design for different devices

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/NBTON/personal-portfolio.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the local development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   This will start a local server at `http://localhost:8080` and automatically open it in your browser.

Alternatively, you can simply open `index.html` directly in your web browser.

The project now organizes styles and scripts in separate folders:
* `css/styles.css` – all custom styles
* `js/main.js` – JavaScript functionality

## Customization
- Update the content in `index.html` to reflect your own projects, skills, and information.
- Add or replace images in the `Images/` directory as needed.
